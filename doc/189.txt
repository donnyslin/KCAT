QUITO , Ecuador 1996-08-23
Ecuador 's President Abdala Bucaram has announced he will hold regular lunches in his presidential palace for members of the country 's different ethnic groups as of next week .
" It was about time for the Indians , the blacks and the mixed-bloods to begin eating in the palace with their president because this is not a palace exclusively for the potentates and ambassadors and protocol , " Bucaram said late on Thursday .
" In these weekly lunches we are going to get to know the problems of the Indian , mixed-race , black and peasant sectors , " he said .
He has invited 35 Indian leaders to lunch next Tuesday .
Bucaram , who was elected on a populist platform last month , also plans to create a ministry for ethnic cultures .
The Andean nation 's population of 11.4 million is 47 percent indigenous .
