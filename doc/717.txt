TIRANA 1996-08-28
Albania asked Greece on Wednesday to explain why it was deporting more Albanian immigrants , Foreign Minister Tritan Shehu said .
The Albanian daily Koha Jone reported earlier that Greece had deported about 5,000 Albanians in the last five days .
" The Foreign Ministry is trying to find out from the Greek embassy why Albanian refugees have been deported from Greece , " Shehu told Reuters .
Athens and Tirana signed an accord in May to legalise the status of Albanian immigrant workers , estimated at 350,000 , and remove a long-standing stumbling block in relations between the two Balkan neighbours .
