On Thursday the Yugoslav government endorsed the text of the agreement on normalising relations between the two countries , the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said .
" The government assessed the agreement as a crucial step to resolving the Yugoslav crisis , ensuring the restoration of peace in former Yugoslavia , " it said .
Last-minute talks this week on the legal fine print finally cleared the way for a treaty based on mutual recognition within internationally recognised borders and the establishment of diplomatic relations , diplomats said .
