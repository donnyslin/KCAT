At least three people were injured when an Amtrak passenger train slammed into an empty logging truck and derailed Tuesday , officials said .
The Vermonter , which runs between St. Albans , Vermont , near the Canadian border and Washington , D.C. , collided with the truck at 7:51 a.m. EDT near the rural town of Roxbury some 15 miles southeast of the state capital Montpelier , Amtrak spokeswoman Maureen Garrity said .
Vermont Central Hospital spokesman Dan Pudvah said two of the injured were treated there -- the truck driver , who was suffering from multiple trauma injuries , and a passenger .
Pudvah said he understood other people with minor injuries were being treated at the scene .
Garrity said a train conductor was also injured .
The train 's engine and its six cars derailed but were still standing , state police said .
The exact number of passangers on the train was not known . "
We had 70 reservations for the train , but that does n't mean there were 70 passengers aboard , " Garrity said .
Uninjured passengers were to be taken by bus to Springfield , Massachusetts , where they will be put aboard another train to continue their journey to New York City and Washington , Garrity said .
She said the train was travelling at 54 mph when it crashed into the truck , which was crossing the tracks onto a dirt road in the rural area bordering the Northfield Mountains .
