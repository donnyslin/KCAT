The New Zealand rugby selectors recalled fly-half Andrew Mehrtens on Wednesday when they announced their team for the third and final test in Johannesburg on Saturday .
He returns in place of Simon Culhane who broke a wrist in the All Blacks ' series-clinching victory in Pretoria on Saturday .
Mehrtens played in the last TriNations test in Cape Town but missed the first two tests in the current series after tearing a cartilage in his knee while training , an injury which needed a small operation .
Lock Ian Jones and wing Jeff Wilson have also been named in the team despite doubts over their fitness .
Jones has a knee injury while Wilson is suffering from a viral infection .
Blair Larsen or the uncapped Glenn Taylor are on standby to replace Jones and , with Jonah Lomu out of action with a shoulder injury picked up in Tuesday 's drawn match against Griqualand West , Eric Rush is favourite to play should Wilson fail to recover .
