ABDERDEEN , Scotland 1996-08-30
French central defender Antoine Kombouare has completed a 300,000 pounds sterling ( $ 467,000 ) move to Aberdeen from Swiss club Sion , the Scottish premier division club said on Friday .
Kombouare has signed a two-year contract and will make his debut against Morton in the Scottish League Cup on Tuesday .
But he will be ineligible for the rest of Aberdeen 's UEFA Cup campaign as he has already played for Sion in this season 's Cup Winners ' Cup .
Aberdeen manager Roy Aitken said : " It 's unfortunate for us that Antoine cannot play in Europe but he will help us achieve things in domestic competition .
" I have been watching him for several weeks now and have no doubts he brings real quality to the side .
He has a great deal of experience and I 'm sure he will quickly establish himself in both the team and the affection of our fans . "
The 32-year-old defender played seven seasons with Nantes and was with Paris St Germain for five seasons .
He said former PSG team mate David Ginola , who now plays for English premier league Newcastle , was influential in his move to Scotland .
" I 'm a very good friend of David and spoke to him recently about coming to Aberdeen and he was very positive about it , " Kombouare said .
" He said I would really enjoy life there and that I would settle in in terms of football as well .
That , and the fact he is only a few hours drive away , influenced my decision to come to Aberdeen . "
