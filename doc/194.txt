U.S. says Iraqi Kurds agree ceasefire .
WASHINGTON 1996-08-23
Leaders of Iraq 's two main Kurdish factions agreed on Friday to end six days of fighting and to attend U.S.-mediated peace talks next month , the State Department said .
Spokesman Glyn Davies said in a statement that the agreement followed direct U.S. contacts with Massoud Barzani , leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) , and Jalal Talabani , leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) .
Davies said the two leaders " have agreed to cease the fighting ( and ) return their forces to the positions held before the current fighting began " on August 17 .
He did not give a specific time for the ceasefire but said the United States looked forward to " immediate implementation " .
The two party leaders had also agreed to meet U.S. Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Robert Pelletreau in September " to solidify the cease-fire and to pursue reconciliation " , Davies said .
His statement gave no venue or precise date for the meeting .
The United States has already called on the Kurdish factions to hold peace talks in London .
The KDP said Thursday night it had repelled an attack by thousands of PUK fighters , killing , wounding or capturing about 400 opposing guerrillas .
The fighting has threatened a U.S.-led peace plan to unite the mountainous Kurdish region in northern Iraq against President Saddam Hussein .
