An Iranian exile group based in Iraq vowed on Thursday to extend support to Iran 's Kurdish rebels after they were attacked by Iranian troops deep inside Iraq last month .
A Mujahideen Khalq statement said its leader Massoud Rajavi met in Baghdad the Secretary-General of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran ( KDPI ) Hassan Rastegar on Wednesday and voiced his support to Iran 's rebel Kurds .
" Rajavi emphasised that the Iranian Resistance would continue to stand side by side with their Kurdish compatriots and the resistance movement in Iranian Kurdistan , " it said .
A spokesman for the group said the meeting " signals a new level of cooperation between Mujahideen Khalq and the Iranian Kurdish oppositions " .
Iran heavily bombarded targets in northern Iraq in July in pursuit of KDPI guerrillas based in Iraqi Kurdish areas outside the control of the government in Baghdad .
Iraqi Kurdish areas bordering Iran are under the control of guerrillas of the Iraqi Kurdish Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) group .
PUK and Iraq 's Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) the two main Iraqi Kurdish factions , have had northern Iraq under their control since Iraqi forces were ousted from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War .
Clashes between the two parties broke out at the weekend in the most serious fighting since a U.S.-sponsored ceasefire last year .
Mujahideen Khalq said Iranian troops had also been shelling KDP positions in Qasri region in Suleimaniya province near the Iranian border over the last two days .
It said about 100 Iraqi Kurds were killed or wounded in the attack .
Both Iran and Turkey mount air and land strikes at targets in northern Iraq in pursuit of their own Kurdish rebels .
