A blind 10-year-old boy from China sneaked over the border into Hong Kong and was arrested as an illegal immigrant , Hong Kong police said on Tuesday .
He was caught by police trying to force his way into a home in the rural New Territories , a police spokesman said .
" The boy came from China 's eastern province of Jiangsu .
He was spotted by a passerby trying to climb into an apartment in the early hours of Monday morning , " the spokesman said .
No decision has yet been made on how to deal with the boy .
Hong Kong police regularly catch hundreds of illegal immigrants and people who have overstayed their visas from mainland China and send them back .
Hong Kong , a British colony , reverts to Chinese control next year but will remain sealed off from the mainland except to a tiny trickle of legal immigrants and people with special visit permits .
