Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro underwent successful surgery in the United States on Monday to correct a compression in her lower spinal column , the government said .
Doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore found an inflamation in her spinal column that , once treated , will free her of chronic pain in her back and one leg that has limited her movement , a government statement said .
" ( Chamorro ) is in good health and , according to her doctors , will be able to return to Nicaragua next week , " it said .
