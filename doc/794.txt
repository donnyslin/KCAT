Iran asks Bonn to extradite ex-president Banisadr .
BONN 1996-08-28
Iran has asked Germany to extradite its former president Abolhassan Banisadr for alleged hijacking , an Iranian embassy spokesman said on Wednesday .
Banisadr angered Tehran last week by accusing top Iranian leaders of ordering the assassination of Iranian Kurdish leaders in a Berlin restaurant in 1992 .
He made the allegations at the trial of an Iranian and four Lebanese accused of carrying out the attack .
An Iranian embassy spokesman said in response to an inquiry that Iran had formally requested Banisadr 's extradition for hijacking the military aircraft which he commandeered to flee Iran in July 1981 .
" We submitted the request three or four days ago , " he said .
German authorities could not immediately be reached for comment .
Banisadr lives under round-the-clock security in France , fearing Tehran could make an attempt on his life .
He is due back in Berlin on September 5 to continue his testimony , which has backed up German prosecutors ' allegations that Tehran ordered the attack on the exiled leaders .
Three dissidents and their translator were killed in the gangland-style machinegun attack .
Iran has warned Germany that bilateral relations could suffer if it pays heed to the testimony of Banisadr , an architect of Iran 's Islamic revolution who has been a sworn enemy of Tehran since he fell from favour after a year as president .
