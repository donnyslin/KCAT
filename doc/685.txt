CRICKET - NEW CAPTAIN TENDULKAR UPSTAGED BY 120 FROM JAYASURIYA .
COLOMBO 1996-08-28
Sachin Tendulkar marked his debut as Indian captain with a patient 110 on Wednesday , but was upstaged by dashing Sri Lankan opener Sanath Jayasuriya whose 120 steered the world champions to a nine-wicket Singer Cup win .
Sri Lanka , playing in front of their home crowd for the first time since winning the World Cup last March , comfortably passed India 's modest 226-5 from 50 overs in 44.2 overs .
The devastating opening pair of Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana shared a fine first wicket stand of 129 to the delight of the 25,000 fans .
Jayasuriya , whose first 50 included three sixes and three fours , went on to an unbeaten 120 and the man-of-the-match award .
Kaluwitharana , slow in comparison , was bowled by Tendulkar for 53 , but Aravinda de Silva with 49 not out helped see Sri Lanka home .
Earlier , Tendulkar completed his ninth century in one-day cricket , taking 138 balls to do it before being run out .
The rest of the Indian batting was generally tied down by brilliant fielding and some fairly tight bowling , although ex-captain Mohamed Azharuddin chipped in with 58 , adding 129 with Tendulkar off 28 overs , before being stumped .
The next match in the four-nation tournament is on Friday when Sri Lanka play Australia in a repeat of the World Cup final in Lahore where Sri Lanka won by seven wickets .
